What is the calculator about? The EMI loan calculator helps you calculate the 
equated monthly instalmentsâ€™ (EMIs) you have to pay the lender each month till the loan is fully paid
.The EMI is based on the loan amount, the tenure, and interest rate. With each successive payment, 
you'll pay more towards the principal and less in interest. Here's the formula to calculate EMI: r is rate 
of interest calculated on monthly basis. (i.e., r = Rate of Annual interest/12/100. If rate of interest is 
10.5% per annum, then r = 10.5/12/100=0.00875).
The interest component of the EMI would be larger during the initial months and gradually reduce 
with each payment. The exact percentage allocated towards payment of the principal depends on the 
interest rate. Even though your monthly EMI payment won't change, the proportion of principal and 
interest components will change with time.
